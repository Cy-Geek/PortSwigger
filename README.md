# PortSwigger Labs Automation
# I made a bunch of scripts to help in the automation process for solving a lot of Port Swigger labs which need to be automated
These scripts help to exploit the vulnerability
There are scripts for: Blind SQL Injection, Authintecation Bypass, Business Logic
In the top of each script there are things need to be changed by you, such as (Lab ID) for portswigger, (User Cookies), (CSRF), (Wordlist Path) in your PC
