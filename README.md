# PortSwigger Labs Automation
## I made a bunch of scripts to help in the automation process for solving a lot of Port Swigger labs which need to be automated
- These scripts help to exploit the vulnerability
- There are scripts for: Blind SQL Injection, Authintecation Bypass, Business Logic
- There are things need to be given by you, such as (Lab ID), (User Cookies), (CSRF), ('Wordlist' given by PortSwigger)
# ------------
- You could use the same idea of the code in anywhere else not only for PortSiwgger, you just need to get the idea of the code
